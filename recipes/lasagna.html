        <h2>Description :</h2>
        <p>Lasagna is a popular oven-baked pasta dish of fresh egg pasta squares. It is a traditional dish from Bologna in Northern Italy, where the sheets are always green through the addition of spinach or nettles to the egg dough.</p>
        <p>In Bologna, these home made sheets are layered with small amounts of real Bolognese ragù (made with both beef and pork, very little tomato and no southern herbs like oregano and basil but a little nutmeg instead) and similarly small amounts of "besciamella" or béchamel sauce in an oven dish.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients :</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 celery ribs, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 1/2 lb (680 g) ground beef</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (28 oz/800 g) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>10-15 basil leaves, chopped or torn</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>225 ml dry red wine</li>
            <li>One pack of lasagne sheets</li>
            <li>1.5 pints (850 ml) béchamel sauce</li>
            <li>Finely grated parmesan</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps :</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a Dutch oven over medium high heat until shimmering. Add in ground beef and cook, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, until all liquid had evaporated and meat begins to sizzle, 10-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in wine, scraping the pot to loosen the fond. Simmer until wine has evaporated.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, bring to a simmer, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, prepare the béchamel sauce.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat the oven to 375F/190C</li>
            <li>Mix the basil, oregano, salt, and pepper into the ragu.</li>
            <li>Place a thin layer of ragu in the base of the ovenproof dish and cover with a single layer of pasta sheets. Spread a layer of béchamel sauce over the pasta. Repeat this until you run out of meat, making sure that you have enough béchamel sauce left to cover the top layer of pasta.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle grated parmesan over the pasta.</li>
            <li>Place the dish in the oven on the top shelf and cook for about 45 minutes, or until the top is lightly browned and the sauce is bubbling.</li>
            <li>Serve.</li>
        </ol>
